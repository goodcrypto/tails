Ticket [[!tails_ticket 8578]],

This page summarizes resources we provide, to help you doing research on Tails more effective.

Based on Debian GNU/Linux, working on Tails is mostly glue work, based on research and existing software.

We'd like to work with the academic research community in order to solve some open research questions that exist for live distributions like Tails. This page consists of various open ended research problems we'd like to see resolved.

When you are working on a research question that is interesting for us as a project or solving a related problem to Tails **please** talk to us. The *earlier* the **better** so we can help you make the *right* assumptions.

When you worked on a problem and published a paper about it, please let us know and we'll list your paper on a page on our website and link it from here.

The best way to reach us is through the [tails-dev](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-dev/) mailinglist.

## Research ideas

 * [Randomness seeding](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/randomness_seeding/)
 * [Persistent Tor state](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/persistent_Tor_state/)
 * [Time syncing](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/robust_time_syncing/)

## User experience

If you're an user interface designer you might be delighted to hear that we have a [mailinglist](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/user_interface/) targeted at you!

Our how page on [improving](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/user_interface/) the Tails user interface might also interest you.

## How to get involved

You picked your project, you're ready to go, now, what do you do? 

Now would be the right time to create an account on the [bug tracker](labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails) so you can update the ticket and assign it to yourself.

Sent an e-mail to the [tails-dev](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-dev/) mailinglist with who you are, what you're going to work on. This is also the best medium to ask questions when you're stuck or to start discussions.

Here's an handy link with a start on how to start [hacking on Tails](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/code/#index6h1).

# Other communities

## Research on Tor

The Tor Project has a page dedicated to open open research questions that they face. Any problem that is solved at Tor, we benefit from and we very much welcome contributions to Tor.

[Tor project Research](https://research.torproject.org/) 

## Academic communities
The questions posed by Tails might me of interest for researchers from various fields. A list of potentially interested communities that we are aware of can be seen below.

 * Anonymity researchers - [PETS](http://petsymposium.org/)
 * Usable Privacy and Security - [SOUPS](https://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/index.html)
 * Computer science in various fields - [USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conferences)

## Other reasonably secure operating systems
Often, the reasonably secure operating systems faces similar challenges. Maybe solutions that we can come up with and implement, are interesting for these other projects. We could share time and resources if they're willing.

An interesting platform to discuss this would be the [Secure OS](https://secure-os.org/) desktops mailinglist.
